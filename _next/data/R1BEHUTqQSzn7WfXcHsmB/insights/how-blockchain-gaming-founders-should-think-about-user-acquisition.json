Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets. The underlying substrate that is the blockchain in theory allows assets (NFTs or fungible tokens) to have utility in any of the applications built on top of it.

Market incumbents in the AdTech space will surely attempt to fill that gap, but traditional gaming attribution platforms are not currently equipped to incorporate cryptocurrencies with fluctuating prices into their platforms. There is likely an opportunity here for crypto-native firms to ship quickly and get out in front of the competition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly, companies operating in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>web3 identity space<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>are well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities to improve access to trustworthy, actionable user acquisition data by bringing together disparate data sources in a way that benefits both players and developers. Gaming is an excellent testing ground for technology like this, given its technical complexity, high transaction volume, and wide range of devices utilized (PC, console, mobile, web browser, etc.). A successful implementation in gaming could be replicated in media and entertainment more broadly, if not other industries entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a company can allow players to maintain better control and privacy over their data (perhaps with the help of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://identitymanagementinstitute.org/zero-knowledge-identity-proof/\">zero-knowledge identity proofs</a>) while also connecting those players to a games industry UA pipeline seeking new ways to reach them, it could have a chance to rival AdTech incumbents like ironSource and AppLovin in the future. That company would also be a prime acquisition candidate for any AAA publisher looking to move into web3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Player identity can also be addressed from the demand side by enabling users to display “<strong>proof of gaming work</strong>”, perhaps via<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://poap.xyz/\">POAPs</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-soulbound-tokens-the-non-transferrable-nft-explained/\">soul-bound tokens</a>. Players with more impressive accomplishments could leverage those for better incentives in gaming ecosystems where they might be in-demand. These accomplishments could be related to in-game achievements, but could also just as easily be tied to ecosystem-building contributions like inviting friends, writing a blog post, or taking part in a playtest. Players would have an incentive to engage, while games businesses would have more actionable information with which to target those valuable players. In practice, this might look something like casino loyalty rewards, an employee discount program, or the Starbucks “stars” system.</p>\n<p>Another potential opportunity exists for a “<strong>CRM of builders</strong>”. As more gaming projects launch in web3, there will be an increasing need for crypto-native community builders and contributors to join these bottom-up ecosystems. These builders will come from a variety of backgrounds, serve an assortment of needs (software engineers, social media marketers, forum moderators, player support, etc.), and will increasingly be utilized as growth partners for web3 games projects. Assembling a robust CRM of high-value contributors could be an excellent business opportunity for a games publisher, gaming guild, or marketing firm seeking to serve a growing audience of game developers. A business like this might be analogized to a staffing firm specific to web3 games projects.&nbsp;There are likely even more opportunities beyond those listed above.<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Fundamentally, there will always be value in providing, storing, and distributing clean, actionable, and compliant data</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to stakeholders across the web3 gaming sector, and this value will only grow as more users are onboarded to web3 in the future.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"160827432","title":"","copy":"<article id=\"post-10646\" class=\"post-10646 post
