Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets. The underlying substrate that is the blockchain in theory allows assets (NFTs or fungible tokens) to have utility in any of the applications built on top of it.

Lifeless interactions not only hurt immersion, but indirectly impact the game experience: if you know the characters around you have only a few canned replies to offer as conversation, why would you spend time engaging with them at all? Lacking NPCs therefore lessen the player’s desire to explore and experiment, to the detriment of play.</p>\n<p><strong>In recent months, AI-enabled characters have seen renewed interest across the industry.<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Technical feasibility aside, we believe a number of factors are contributing to this trend.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Recurrence</strong>: Long and frequent play sessions in persistent worlds mean you’re likely to encounter some characters repeatedly. To make sure these interactions are always entertaining, informational, or both, with repeat potential, developers are looking to move beyond static dialogue trees and toward more adaptive conversational and behavioral systems.</li>\n  <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: As virtual worlds get bigger and more complex, they are being filled with hundreds to thousands of NPCs. While not all those characters will have the same significance, it’s important that they all offer players at least an acceptable level of interaction — call it a MVI, or Minimum Viable Interaction. While scripting so many dialogues and personalities manually would be impractical, AI can help scale up that process.</li>\n  <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: With ubiquitous recommendation algorithms, consumer apps from Netflix to Spotify provide a constantly upgraded consumption experience. As we continue to spend more time inside virtual worlds, these expectations will likely apply to their content and narratives, too. Developers looking to improve engagement will find value in AI-driven personalization, from dynamically balancing game difficulty to adapting a companion NPC’s playstyle to the player’s.</li>\n  <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: While the success of “low-fi” games and platforms like Minecraft and Roblox can’t be overstated, the overall trend with each new generation of gaming hardware is one of increased photorealism across all dimensions, including graphics, physics, and lighting. With the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>visual</em><span>&nbsp;</span>aspect of games getting more and more lifelike, it’s only logical that characters would act accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s notable that this list features both player-centric (recurrence, personalization, consistency) and developer-centric drivers (scalability).
