Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets. The underlying substrate that is the blockchain in theory allows assets (NFTs or fungible tokens) to have utility in any of the applications built on top of it.

They can then transact with other addresses within the rollup state by sending transaction data to the sequencer node(s). The sequencer node(s) orders, executes and compresses thousands of transactions down to a single transaction representing the cumulative state transition and commits it back to Ethereum.

This is of course a big assumption to make, as public blockchains are highly adversarial environments. To combat this, optimistic rollups have a lengthy time to finality (1 – 2 weeks), referred to as a challenge period. During this period, if a network participant suspects an illegitimate transaction has taken place they can submit a fraud proof. The rollup protocol will check the fraud proof, and if upheld, the transaction(s) in question will be re-executed to generate a new rollup state. Additionally the sequencer responsible will face a financial penalty and the provider of the fraud proof will receive a financial reward. This game theoretic mechanism is unique to optimistic rollups. However, because the state may need to be recalculated, optimistic rollups have to post more data to Ethereum than a zkRollup would. Data storage accounts for the majority of all fees on Ethereum, so Optimistic rollups are not the cheapest option.

This can be clearly be seen in number of EVM chains (e.g. BNB Chain, Avalanche etc…) as well as the proliferation of scaling solutions built around Ethereum. Zkrollups, and by extension zkEVMs, are the most secure scaling solution, as their state is managed by smart contracts on the Ethereum base-layer. They also have the least latency, as finality is reached as soon as the zkProof is verified on Ethereum. Ultimately, they have the potential to revolutionize Web3 gaming by making previously uneconomical use-cases more feasible. That being said, the tech is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it reaches maturity. Both users and developers need to be aware of this and manage risk accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There’s a reason why projects are competing to be the first functioning zkEVM on mainnet. Not only does it feed into crypto’s attention economy, but being first provides the best chance of&nbsp; attracting builders and creating an early competitive moat. The tech is new and shiny right now, but as is also the case with layer 1 blockchains, zkEVMs will likely become commoditized over time. Prevalence of layer 3’s and core Ethereum upgrades like Danksharding will significantly enhance Ethereum’s scalability. This could result in innovation being pushed up to the application layer. The platforms that have built the strongest ecosystems of dapps with great content and solid network effects will have a huge advantage over the rest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our opinion, what really matters in this quest is how projects maximize the developer experience.

If the solution is performant enough to meet their needs, has great support and good tooling then that’s what they’ll likely choose.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That being said, different platforms today may be more attractive to certain types of builders.

So if you are building something cool on one of these new platforms we’d love to speak to you.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true}],"referenceTitle":"References","references":[{"title":"Ethereum EVM Illustrated","url":"https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf"},{"title":"Ground Up Guide: zkEVM, EVM Compatibility & Rollups","url":"https://immutablex.medium.com/ground-up-guide-zkevm-evm-compatibility-rollups-787b6e88108e"},{"title":"Proof-of-Stake (PoS)","url":"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/"},{"title":"The Different Types of ZK-EVMs","url":"https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html"},{"title":"The ZK Everything Report (Messari Pro)","url":"https://messari.io/report/the-zk-everything-report"},{"title":"What is a zkEVM: Types of zkEVMs, How They Work, and Why They Matter","url":"https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/zkevm#where-are-we-in-the-development-progress-of-zkevms"},{"title":"Zero-Knowledge Proofs","url":"https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/"},{"title":"Data Availability","url":"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability/"},{"title":"StarkWare Sessions 23 | Kakarot Project Lead | Elias Tazartes & Clément Walter","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIqnhWdxpA"},{"title":"UniSync: a port of Uniswap V2 on the zkEVM","url":"https://blog.matter-labs.io/unisync-a-port-of-uniswap-v2-on-the-zkevm-b12954748504"},{"title":"zkSync 2.0: Hello Ethereum!","url":"https://blog.matter-labs.io/zksync-2-0-hello-ethereum-ca48588de179"},{"title":"All Aboard zkSync Era Mainnet","url":"https://blog.matter-labs.io/all-aboard-zksync-era-mainnet-8b8964ba7c59"},{"title":"Setting the record straight on zkEVM – Polygon Pod","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TYVFzba4EI"},{"title":"Ex-Electronic Arts, Sony Game Developers Raise $13 Million For ‘Avalon’ Digital Universe","url":"https://decrypt.co/122329/ex-electronic-arts-sony-game-developers-raise-13-million-for-avalon-digital-universe"},{"title":"Danksharding: Ethereum’s Scalabilty Killer","url":"https://research.thetie.io/danksharding-ethereums-scalability-killer-post-merge/"},{"title":"Rollup, Validium, Volition — Where is your data stored","url":"https://www.starknet.io/es/posts/engineering/rollup-validium-volition-where-is-your-data-stored"}],"slug":"the-zkevm-the-next-frontier-of-web3-gaming","title":"The zkEVM – The Next Frontier of Web3 Gaming","featured":true,"heroImage":{"responsiveImage":{"sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","src":"https://www.datocms-assets.com/98662/1684936628-light-speed.jpg?auto=format","width":1920,"height":1080,"alt":null,"title":"Light Speed Image","base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoICAgLFgoLDhgQDg4OFh8NFhEYFxcZGCIVFhUaHysjGh0oHRUWJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLDg0OHA4NHC8cFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIAA4AGAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAYAAACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBQABA//EABwQAAIDAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMEBRGBEv/EABYBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBf/EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AFe63OqkAxLl21U6/Yy0cer29FoOeEqFwP1L7TohiQJu31OQe5cxv41EUdNJCrLgNyn/2Q=="}},"excerpt":"<p>Ethereum currently has the strongest network effects of any smart contract layer 1 blockchain.
