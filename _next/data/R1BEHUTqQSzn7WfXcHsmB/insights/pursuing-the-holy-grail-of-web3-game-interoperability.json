Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets.

Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context.

Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets.

Bringing in “foreign” game assets risks ruining that immersion that players crave. If multiple games all support the same set of game assets, it’s easy to see how each of these games will become less differentiated over time. Furthermore, it’s a difficult enough feat to balance gameplay in a closed ecosystem. Weapons, perks and abilities need to be carefully tuned so that any combination doesn’t make a player OP (over powered) in order to maintain fair, skill-based gameplay. If a game had a fully open and permissionless ecosystem that allowed players to bring in weapons and items from other games, this balancing act would become a near-impossible task for the developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are also a lot of complexities when it comes to negotiating the business/financial incentives for allowing external assets into a game. For instance, how does the game developer protect their user base and profitability if their assets can be taken elsewhere or if external assets created and paid for in another game or bought on secondary markets can enter their game? Interoperability adds complexity both in terms of execution and game balance, and thus increases costs for the developer. It will also likely introduce compromises in game functionality, as games will need to support a more generic asset model rather than tailoring to the specific game experience. As such, there will need to be significant incentives to adding interoperability features to a game to make it viable from a business perspective.

This could occur through a mutually beneficial agreement between two projects or it could take the form of a user acquisition attack on a popular project’s open social graph. This is sometimes referred to as a vampire attack in crypto parlance, whereby users are incentivized away from one project towards another. In either case it’s straightforward to get a list of all holders of a specific NFT and airdrop them new NFTs. Often this is targeted at popular or blue chip projects, as it’s a great way to bring attention and generate hype around a game. We have seen a very recent example of this with the collaboration between<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/castaways_gg/status/1583577439326076928\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Castaways and DigiDaigaku</a>. However, this is not true interoperability in the sense of shared assets, i.e. the DigiDaigaku assets are not actually in the Castaways game, they are recreations that had to be designed and coded by the Castaways developers. Due to the labor requirements, this limits the scalability of this method somewhat. However, the user acquisition benefits offset the additional work required to a certain extent. This manual labor requirement by developers and designers may become less so in the future as AI-driven 3D asset creation tools like<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.kaedim3d.com/\">Kaedim</a><span>&nbsp;</span>become increasingly prevalent.

On-chain games perhaps represent one of the most compelling and innovative uses of blockchain technology within gaming and interoperability. Not only are game assets and currencies recorded on-chain, so too is the game logic and every action performed by players.</p>\n<p>Recording all player actions and game logic on a public blockchain poses some unique challenges, as a lot of games rely on the notion of hidden information. A relevant example would be that of an MMO where there is the concept of fog of war (obfuscated unexplored zones in the map). If all coordinates and resource locations are recorded on a public blockchain there’s nothing stopping players from viewing this data and discovering the location of a valuable resource or an enemy base. This problem is solved on Starknet through the use of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/\">zkSTARK</a><span>&nbsp;</span>proofs (zero-knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge), which allows transactions to be committed and verified on Ethereum without revealing their contents. This opens up the possibility of creating a much richer on-chain gaming experience because it enables games to incorporate hidden knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One example of a game that makes great use of this feature is<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://zkga.me/\">Dark Forest</a>, a space themed 4X strategy MMO. Players start with a home planet and a huge shared universe. The aim of the game is to explore, collect materials, upgrade infrastructure and expand your territory by claiming other neutral and player-owned planets. Planets produce ships and planets are captured by sending more ships than the current number stored there. The game ends when only one faction remains. Exploration works a little bit like proof-of-work mining, whereby discovering a new set of coordinates (previously obfuscated by fog of war) requires players to compute a hash of those coordinates. The resulting hash is compared with a list of all hashed contents of the universe. If a match is detected, the corresponding asset is found there. It actually uses the player’s CPU to compute the hash and even allows them to select how many cores they want to use.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true},{"__typename":"M001ImageLargeRecord","id":"160681176","image":{"responsiveImage":{"sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px","src":"https://www.datocms-assets.com/98662/1685538043-astral.png?auto=format","width":512,"height":253,"alt":null,"title":null,"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoICAgLCgoXDhMVEhUUDhUVFhUOFxUdGBYfIhUmHysjHR0oHRUWJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLDg0OHA4NHC8oFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy81Ly8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIAAwAGAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAZAAABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAAMEBQf/xAAeEAACAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwABBBEhIgUGE//EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCAf/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIREB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDOc3OYC9WNysJxNHeoc+xePxQV1XVQWJKxVwMVWhHMI1vYONVVUUcKq+UUFnpsP//Z"}},"caption":"The Dark Forest WebGL client.","source":"<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\">\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>// Image Source</em>:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://zkga.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dark Forest</a></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>"},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"160681177","title":"","copy":"<p>Because all game logic and actions are stored and recorded on-chain there is no need for a centralized game server or database on the backend.

Perhaps a good place to start is defining what a game asset is. As Raph Koster discusses in his excellent series<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.playableworlds.com/news/riffs-by-raph:-how-virtual-worlds-work-part-4/\">How Virtual Worlds Work</a>, in its simplest form, an in-game object or item is a data structure containing things like visual representation (art), metadata, traits and stats relating to the item utility etc. Script components that define an item’s in-game behavior can be attached to the data model but ultimately, they do not encapsulate the whole game system. What we mean by this is that the item’s behavior will have dependencies on other game assets. For example, if a game supports the concept of food, then food items will probably have some sort of food script attached to them that defines their behavior, how much HP they regenerate when consumed for instance. This implies that an entity in the game will eat the food, which in turn means that this entity needs to have some sort of “food eater” script attached. If one of these game assets travels to another virtual world without the other, the scripts now have missing dependencies and make no sense. This makes open asset interoperability beyond simple cosmetic items challenging to say the least. Furthermore, the underlying game logic is what interprets and executes this behavior in the context of the game world. It therefore goes without saying that whatever game engine has been used needs to be capable of parsing the data format the asset is represented in.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true},{"__typename":"M003ImageSmallRecord","id":"160681190","image":{"responsiveImage":{"sizes":"(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px","src":"https://www.datocms-assets.com/98662/1685538239-playable-worlds.png?auto=format","width":496,"height":512,"alt":null,"title":null,"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"}},"caption":"In-game items can have scripts attached that define functionality.","source":"<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\">\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>// Image Source</em>:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.playableworlds.com/news/riffs-by-raph:-how-virtual-worlds-work-part-4/\">Playable Worlds</a></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>"},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"160681191","title":"","copy":"<p>In theory you could have an agreement between two game developers to use a set of design guidelines, which would allow them to implement asset behavior in the same way, and thus make their assets interoperable. However, this becomes a social coordination challenge and requires sufficient incentives on both sides to make the increased complexity and cost worthwhile. For this reason, arrangements like this will likely be the exception rather than the default across the games industry, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>That being said there are projects that are developing systems and tools that take a set of behavioral components defining an assets animations and behavior in various states, serializes them and embeds them within NFTs. These can then be de-serialized and processed by native game engine behavior controller implementations. During in-game use, the NFT’s metadata (e.g. item condition) is dynamically updated and submitted to the blockchain in a rollup along with a zero-knowledge proof. This way the item maintains a consistent state if taken to a new game. This is potentially a novel solution to the problem but is yet to be proven in production. When asked about the viability of such a solution, Frost Giant CEO, Tim Morten commented, “There are some interim data formats that can be parsed by a game engine, but this is inefficient because we optimize our data formats for load time. As soon as I have to do some sort of object conversion into my native data format, I’m incurring a processing hit for every asset, so it’s not a good user experience. You could come up with some sort of preprocessor where, if you have a set of assets in a format that’s not native, you preprocess those to native format so that you only incur the hit once for the player. However, it’s not efficient to generalize formats for games and the volume of data that we load is so massive that you’re talking about increasing loading time perhaps by 5x which is just not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>Another approach to sharing asset behavior across worlds could involve loading a set of standardized behavior scripts from a remote repository. Raph Koster alludes to this in the aforementioned series, How Virtual Worlds Work:</p>\n<p>“Scripts are just data – just text! — you could load them from a remote site. If there’s a popular set of scripts that lots of people load from a common location on the web, then standards could start to emerge based on actual usage. As long as scripts could actually add data fields on the fly, as long as scripts could come packaged with all dependencies internal, and as long as things like “eaten” could be just messages to the object – you could indeed share behaviors across worlds.”</p>\n<p>For many years software, games included, have been constructed using composable third-party libraries and modules. It is a very efficient and safe way of building, as there’s no need to reinvent the wheel if commonly used logic has already been written, battle-tested and open sourced. However, it’s inevitable that as time moves forward and complexity grows, bugs and vulnerabilities will work their way into these modules and as a result will get propagated across all software utilizing them. This is not so much of an issue if there is a centralized entity responsible for managing that codebase, as they can act quickly to remedy the situation and release new versions. However, this all becomes a bit messy if we want true decentralization through DAO governance, community proposals and voting.</p>\n<p>When thinking about what type of cross-game interoperability we’re going to see in the short-term it is likely to be limited to purely cosmetic items like skins. The lack of the need for behavior components with these assets somewhat simplifies the technical challenges. However, there will still need to be some sort of conversion to native data formats, which as mentioned above needs to be considered with respect to loading times and player experience. Moreover, when asked if he could ever see a future scenario where the games industry coalesced around a common set of open standards Tim Morten replied, “If we as developers have a business incentive to do it then yes, but right now there is zero incentive. In fact, I would actually pay for technology that prevented such a thing from happening in order to protect my customer base. It will also commoditize what I do and if it doesn’t put me out of a job it will limit the upside on what my business can make.” Although this puts a damper on dreams of a decentralized interoperable metaverse, Tim’s point is a valid one. Game developers are ultimately businesses and have to maintain an edge in order to remain profitable and sustainable. Perhaps as the technology matures, emergent business models will develop that allow developers to monetize in alternative ways or maybe player demand will eventually force games developers to pivot. One thing that is clear is that cross-game interoperability poses immense challenges from a technical perspective and perhaps more so from a business and social coordination perspective. As a result it will likely take longer than people expect to become a reality and may look different from what Web3 gamers envision today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One final project that deserves a mention is<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PetaverseNetwrk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Petaverse</a>. The project is currently in development by Tiny Rebel Games and aims to to create digital NFT companions that can last in perpetuity, regardless of the comings and goings of different blockchains, metaverses, games and platforms. They state that interoperability and ownership are strongly related. If you “own” an NFT that is dependent on the continued existence of a specific metaverse or blockchain and one day the underlying infrastructure gets shut down for whatever reason, then your asset has no utility and becomes worthless or in the worst-case, ceases to exist entirely. They argue that if you have an asset that can be ported onto any blockchain and has utility across many different ecosystems, then it is inherently more valuable and resilient.</p>\n<p>To achieve this vision, they are developing what they call a metadata-managed “passport” system for their Petaverse NFTs. The ERC721 token contains a unique ID that points to off-chain metadata (a common approach for NFT’s created on chains where block space is expensive). This metadata functions like a universal-access “save file” and is accessible/updatable from any blockchain currently supported by the project. It contains things like the pets’ physical details and appearance, personality traits, moral alignments, inventory of toys, clothing etc. The protocol allows users to clone their NFT onto any supported chain and “stamps” the metadata with a reference to this new (non-transferrable) NFT, enabling ownership of clones to be traced back to the original NFT. Because each clone references the same off-chain metadata, any changes made to this data are synced to all versions.</p>\n<p>Having the metadata openly available allows external development teams to freely access and interpret this data in their own game in whatever way they see fit. It is also not too hard to imagine a scenario where this metadata also contains a set of scripts that define the way the pet should behave and interact in a virtual world. However, as mentioned earlier, this still requires game/metaverse developers to interpret the data and code logic to interact with these scripts. If Petaverse or another similar project became widely adopted and popular you might see developers going the extra mile to support these assets in their games in order to bring in users.</p>\n<p>One obvious elephant in the room is that the metadata is centralized in a database managed by Tiny Rebels. This is not their long-term plan but in order to hit the ground running and maximize player experience the project has opted to start from a place of centralization. As decentralized CDNs and storage network technologies like the IPFS network mature and become able to support fast read/write operations on relatively large datasets at scale, they will progressively move toward decentralization. Due to the challenging nature of distributed computing this transitioning from initial centralization to decentralization is quite commonplace for projects in Web3.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true},{"__typename":"T014SectionTitleRecord","id":"160681192","title":"Conclusion"},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"160681193","title":"","copy":"<p>There are many different teams working on different types of interoperability solutions in the Web3 space. Some, like Spanning Labs and Petaverse revolve around making assets cross-chain or chain agnostic and aim to enhance both developer and user experience by abstracting away the blockchain backend and allowing each party to focus on what they do best. It is our belief that these sorts of projects will contribute to the eventual commoditization of blockspace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other teams, like all those involved in the Lootverse and Dark Forest, are completely reinventing the way games are built from the ground up, putting the power of creation squarely in the hands of the community and encouraging interoperability, composability and extensibility. As the technology required to build on-chain games evolves, this will be a very interesting space to watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The vision of a “Ready Player One” metaverse where every game asset can go anywhere and interact in a deep and meaningful way with a myriad of environments, items and other players seems unrealistic, at least for the foreseeable future. There are sizable technological, social coordination and business hurdles that need to be solved before we can see this sort of interoperability at any sort of scale beyond strategic partnerships between a few projects. In the near-term we may see interoperability solutions involving purely cosmetic items like skins, as these assets are simpler to incorporate because they do not interact with the game environment and do not cause game balance issues.</p>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<p>We at BITKRAFT are excited about the future of Web3 gaming and are actively investing in it.

Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets. The underlying substrate that is the blockchain in theory allows assets (NFTs or fungible tokens) to have utility in any of the applications built on top of it. Many Web3 gamers envision being able to take their in-game characters/items earned or crafted in one game and use them in another
