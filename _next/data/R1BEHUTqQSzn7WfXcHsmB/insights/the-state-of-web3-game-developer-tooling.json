Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets.

E2E solutions offer the best developer experience as the full stack is designed to seamlessly work together. A key feature of E2E solutions lies in abstracting away a lot of blockchain complexity through no/ low code tools, in addition to providing developer support. Vendors are also incentivised to keep their offering up to date with the latest innovations in the Web3 space, whilst providing cost savings for teams through bundling or risk customer churn. All this allows games teams to focus on their core expertise.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, teams may experience a lack of flexibility and varying degrees of lock-in. Founders should be wary of their game becoming dependent on the survival of the underlying solution, as the long-term sustainability of current Web3 infrastructure business models has yet to be proven. Founders should also be aware of who retains ownership over any deployed smart contracts. While migrating to a new vendor always entails some switching costs, founders can minimize these by planning for such scenarios.</span></p>\n<p><b>Modular Approach</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The modular approach grants founders more flexibility, as they can cherry-pick point solutions from a variety of vendors and open source projects. This significantly reduces reliance on any single vendor thus minimizing dependency, lock-in and rent seeking risks. However, the modular approach can be time-consuming and expensive due to the need for research, setup, ongoing maintenance, and most importantly in–depth knowledge of each and every “mod” including competitor solutions and underlying strengths and weaknesses of each. Consequently, this approach may be better suited to experienced teams already adept at navigating the Web3 landscape.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, many founders will find themselves using a combination of E2E and point solutions. The blockchain's openness allows for a high level of composability when constructing a tech stack. This flexibility empowers teams to tailor their approach based on their specific requirements. Ultimately, the decision lies in striking the right balance between cost, convenience, usability (for developers and players), flexibility, and features.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>BITKRAFT View: Teams looking to develop Web2.5 games, or teams without full-time blockchain developers are best off choosing a E2E solution, as this allows them to focus on creating engaging core game loops. Teams that wish to leverage the unique aspects of Web3, e.g., having more game logic on-chain or creating bespoke interoperability features, should consider a more flexible, modular approach.</i></b></p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":false},{"__typename":"T014SectionTitleRecord","id":"8dqkCXalS3eUtzR3DEOqlg","title":"2.

Given the constantly evolving nature of the blockchain landscape, keeping options open is generally preferred as this path offers the greatest optionality. Nonetheless, it's important to note that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (“EVM”) is the original smart contract platform with widespread developer adoption, and hence the most future-proof option given the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect#:~:text=The%20Lindy%20effect%20(also%20known,proportional%20to%20their%20current%20age.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lindy Effect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, emerging ecosystems like Sui and Aptos (both of which use the </span><a href=\"https://www.bitkraft.vc/moving-on-up-exploring-the-move-smart-contract-language/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move smart contract language</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) or Cosmos could be worth considering, as they aim to address limitations found in legacy smart contract platforms like the EVM, so it ultimately still depends on the needs of the underlying product and which chain is best positioned to fulfill those needs</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One good example of the above would be games leveraging web3 to primarily enable digital asset ownership,&nbsp; but do not require any custom logic. Platforms like </span><a href=\"https://www.immutable.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ImmutableX</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Solana are great starting points for such games: Immutable’s APIs provide accessible interfaces with the blockchain, while Solana has dedicated software development kits (“SDKs”) for popular game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For games that require more than asset ownership, founders may want to consider launching on their own dedicated blockchain, sometimes referred to as an app chain. There are various startups and ecosystems available to support this requirement. Notable options include </span><a href=\"https://polygon.technology/polygon-supernets\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polygon Supernets</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://docs.avax.network/learn/avalanche/subnets-overview\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avalanche Subnets</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://cosmos.network/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://arbitrum.foundation/orbit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arbitrum Orbit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Rollup-as-a-Service platforms like </span><a href=\"https://www.eclipse.builders/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eclipse</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or the </span><a href=\"https://stack.optimism.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OP Stack</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These offer teams the flexibility to customize their infrastructure to meet their specific needs, such as launching native tokens, subsidizing transaction fees or achieving ultrafast finality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is worth mentioning as well that many chains have entities associated with them that offer grants, as a way to incentivize builders. Examples include </span><a href=\"https://esp.ethereum.foundation/applicants\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://near.org/ecosystem/get-funding\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Near</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://sui.io/developer-grants\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sui</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.immutable.com/fund\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immutable</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://tezos.foundation/grants/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tezos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and many others, but we do not believe this should be the key reason for building on a chain as it ignores longer-term considerations in lieu of short-term capital support.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>BITKRAFT View: As the space matures, we believe it will undergo consolidation and commodification. Furthermore, while the initial phase of Web3 games relied on crypto-native communities to drive adoption, the next phase will target a much broader audience and will therefore require technology that is capable of servicing the mainstream audience such as EVM chains, which have the most developer tooling and (player) liquidity. For now, it’s prudent to remain flexible as long as possible by only committing to a chain when necessary.

There are currently two approaches to solving this issue in a trustless manner: multi-party computation (MPC) and smart contract wallets (often shortened to smart wallets). Both enable account recovery, by allowing multiple signatories to authorize transactions.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>MPC wallet</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MPC wallet infrastructure such as </span><a href=\"https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/core-kit/mpc-core-kit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web3Auth</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses off-chain distributed key management to decentralize the control of a user's wallet. The private key is divided up into shares and trustlessly held by multiple parties.

This approach is sometimes referred to as semi-custodial as the company encrypts the user’s private key in their database, but has no way to access it without input from the user. Combine this with an open standard like </span><a href=\"https://webauthn.guide/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebAuthn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which allows users to authenticate into web apps using smartphones instead of passwords, and Web3 UX can be significantly improved for mainstream audiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automatically deploying wallets for players means they do not have to install a wallet app in order to start playing and hence allows players to game without knowing that a wallet is involved. It also gives developers more control over UX, enabling features like initializing new wallets with in-game currency, only displaying relevant digital assets, subsidizing transaction fees, etc. Players can be eased into the Web3 experience and progressively exposed to more complex Web3 concepts when they are ready.

Given that the current player base for Web3 games is small, launchers with go-to-market strategies that are focused on acquiring games on their platform (e.g. Hyperplay) vs focusing on acquiring users will be better positioned to succeed long-term. Similar to the Web2 game launcher market, we anticipate this will be a winner takes most market as the first launcher to acquire a meaningful user base will be able to leverage flywheel effects and horizontally expand their product offering both on the developer and consumer side. Although incumbents such as Steam and EGS pose a major risk to emerging Web3 native launchers, we believe they will be slow to incorporate Web3 features which will be core to the player’s experience and as a result give emerging launchers a chance to succeed in this vertical</i></b></p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":false},{"__typename":"T014SectionTitleRecord","id":"BgOZy0RkTG2gJBqGErnP2g","title":"11.

Games teams building on their platform are able to mint in-game NFTs for players by locking a quantity of RDYX tokens inside them. In addition to extrinsic value provided by scarcity and in-game utility, this process also gives the NFTs intrinsic value, pegged to the value of the RDYX token. Players are able to stake these NFTs in a smart contract to receive token rewards. During the staking period players can still use the NFTs in-game but they are unable to trade them.

This is primarily because the bulk of value within these ecosystems tends to be propelled by network effects and distribution.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>BITKRAFT View: Tokenized gaming ecosystems present an interesting possibility of creating a physical arcadelike experience digitally that promotes cross-promotion and discovery amongst new games. Tokenized gaming ecosystems can maximize total value for a portfolio of games. However, this is at the cost of limiting the upside of an ecosystem’s most successful titles. Tokenized gaming ecosystems must find ways of creating significant lock-in for content on their platform. Whether it be through seeding their own content (e.g </i></b><a href=\"https://www.shardbound.com/\"><b><i>Shardbound</i></b></a><b><i> for Bazooka Tango’s ecosystem) or providing key infrastructure (e.g Immutable, Polygon), being able to create ways to disincentivize studios/content from leaving the ecosystem will be vital.

Below we cover the facets important to gaming studios solving for UA:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Finding users:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the Web3 space, studios trying to acquire users have the added challenge of pseudonymity as they often only know a user’s wallet address and holdings. </span><a href=\"https://godmodehq.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GodmodeHQ</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.addressable.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addressable</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aim to solve this problem by creating a product that matches a user's wallet with other social media profiles such as Twitter and Discord. This gives studios access to more traditional user acquisition channels. There are also platforms such as </span><a href=\"https://docs.carv.io/overview/carv-intro\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carv</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://polkastarter.gg/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polkastarter.gg</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://forge.gg/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that aim to build player specific gaming profiles that can be leveraged by studios for more effective targeting.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Attracting users:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We have also seen multiple companies such as </span><a href=\"https://www.communitygaming.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Gaming</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://galxe.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galxe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://beta.dequest.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dequest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://layer3.xyz/quests\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Layer3</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.intract.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intract</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.ovio.gg/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ovio.gg</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pursue questing as a service (QaaS). The basic premise of QaaS is to incentivize users to complete various quests in games. This redirects a portion of UA spend directly towards the player in the form of rewards (vs towards ad spend). The intention is to lower CAC over time by building a monolithic platform where studios can find and acquire users cheaper than by using traditional channels. Although we are seeing multiple different approaches to UA in Web3 gaming, the stark reality confronting every company at the moment, is the limited pool of players available for acquisition.</span></p>\n<p><b>Allocating ad spend:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Attribution, a traditional Web2 concept, is the practice of evaluating the marketing touchpoints a consumer encounters on their path to purchase. Without knowing where users have come from, it is difficult to know where to allocate your ad budget. This is incredibly difficult to get right in Web3 given the aforementioned complexities of wallets and pseudonymity. We are only aware of </span><a href=\"https://blog.spindl.xyz/p/the-spindl-take-on-web-3-privacy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spindl</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.safary.club/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> building a ‘targeted solution in the space thus far, but we are aware of other analytics and growth startups looking to build solutions here as a horizontal offering to their core product offerings. We remain excited to see how the space unfolds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b><i>BITKRAFT View: UA and its analytics is a core problem that has yet to be solved in crypto. This is primarily due to (1) the low liquidity (i.e., user supply) in Web3 publishing platforms, and (2) the rapid evolution of Web3 marketing techniques themselves as companies search for profitable growth. Historically, UA campaigns in Web3 were focused on community centric high-touch campaigns or expensive UA through tokenized incentives. We believe Web3 will unlock new avenues for studios to acquire users due to key traits of the blockchains such as added transparency. Companies that are able to “crack the code” and find methods to efficiently acquire users will benefit from first-mover advantages that will allow them to build data/customer moats, allowing them to iterate on their product offering quicker than competitors.
