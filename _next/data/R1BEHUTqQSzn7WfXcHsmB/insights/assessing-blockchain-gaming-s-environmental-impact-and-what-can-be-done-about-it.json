Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets. The underlying substrate that is the blockchain in theory allows assets (NFTs or fungible tokens) to have utility in any of the applications built on top of it.

Though cryptocurrencies are no strangers to ecological controversy, the sudden rise of NFTs and the attempt of a number of gaming publishers to implement them inside their properties have brought new grist to the mill of the cryptosceptic crowd.</p>\n<p><strong>Reports upon reports aim to remind us that crypto is following an environmentally worrying path</strong>. As the historical pioneer and the coin with the largest market cap today, Bitcoin remains the main culprit. In 2018, the network’s consumption was<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/07/09/why-bitcoin-uses-so-much-energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“roughly the same as Ireland’s.”</a><span>&nbsp;</span>In 2021, it was said to be around 91 terawatt-hours, more than is used by Finland. In 2022, it could reach 138 terawatt-hours, “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/bitcoin-is-red-hot-can-it-ever-be-green/2022/03/30/07637e8e-b09e-11ec-9dbd-0d4609d44c1c_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more than a country like Norway</a>.” You get the gist: Bitcoin is energy-intensive, and increasingly so. The global distribution of the industry complicates things even more,<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>as the negligence of a few bad students undermines the efforts of a well-meaning majority.</p>\n<p>Some of these concerns do have some weight to them. Critics often put forth the industry standard of “energy consumed per transaction,” a metric that would appear to put Bitcoin at a clear disadvantage (which we will evaluate later in the article) considering the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">relatively low number</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of transactions it’s able to handle despite its aggregate energy consumption.</p>\n<p>Still, the outcry seems unwarranted. Last year, New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG)<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://nydig.com/research/report-bitcoin-net-zero\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">compared Bitcoin’s energy consumption</a><span>&nbsp;</span>with that of other innovations and found it to be considerably lower. Overall, Bitcoin mining represents an estimated 0.1% of global carbon emissions and could still contribute to only 0.9% of emissions by 2030.

As you may have guessed, the aptly named blockchain is, essentially… a chain of data blocks, each of which stores a certain amount of information permanently recorded and publicly readable in an open, decentralized ledger. To add new blocks to that chain, PoW requires network nodes — the miners — to solve complex mathematical puzzles using their computing power. The miner who solves this puzzle first gets to confirm the most recent block of transactions and broadcast it. Once that data has been collectively validated by the network, a new block is added to the chain, and the miner receives a reward typically paid out in the network’s native currency — for example, Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em>(Though having a minimum understanding of the mechanism is important, we know the nitty-gritty of it can be hard to grasp!

Any blockchain-enabled minting or burning, purchase or transfer, or any financial interaction conducted inside that game generates emissions the same way it would outside of it. Therefore, exactly “how much blockchain” you decide to integrate inside your title has a direct impact on its energy consumption. To date, this has come in three forms:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Most blockchain-related gaming initiatives have had to do with<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>NFTs</strong>.

The more your game’s story and play experience rely on mechanics like minting, farming, mining, and crafting either fungible or non-fungible tokens, the more state changes are actually registered on the blockchain, the more energy-intensive your game is likely to be.</li>\n  <li>Closely related to this is the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>rapid financialization of games</strong>.

This, combined with built-in bridging and the ability to batch transactions and send multiple types of tokens simultaneously, saves users time, fees, and energy. Sequence also lets developers bundle and parallelize large amounts of transactions, reducing the load on the blockchain and thus the associated carbon footprint.
