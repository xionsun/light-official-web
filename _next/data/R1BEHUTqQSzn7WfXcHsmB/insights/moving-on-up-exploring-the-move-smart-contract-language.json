Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets.

They extended the decentralized p2p payments functionality pioneered by Bitcoin into a globally distributed computing platform. This innovation enabled the creation of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and many other emergent technologies. Since then, smart contracts have been implemented in multiple languages across different chains. In spite of this, the vast majority of smart contracts today are still written in<a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Solidity</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and run on various EVM implementations across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum and<a href=\"https://defillama.com/chains/EVM\"><span>&nbsp;</span>many others</a>.</p>\n<p>That being said, Solidity has known<a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/security-considerations.html\"><span>&nbsp;</span>security vulnerabilities</a>, some of which have been responsible for high profile<a href=\"https://defillama.com/hacks\"><span>&nbsp;</span>hacks</a><span>&nbsp;</span>like the $611m<a href=\"https://slowmist.medium.com/the-root-cause-of-poly-network-being-hacked-ec2ee1b0c68f\"><span>&nbsp;</span>access control exploit</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of Poly Network in August 2021. Due to the lack of native security protections, Solidity developers have to explicitly defend against vulnerabilities and exploits, and mistakes can become extremely costly. All this detracts attention away from what developers should be focusing on – building great user experiences – and represents a primary blocker to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. Risks can be mitigated to a certain extent with high test coverage and code audits. However, these are expensive and are still no guarantee of complete safety.</p>\n<p>Close behind Solidity in terms of smart contract developer adoption is the general purpose language, Rust. This is the language of choice on Near, Solana, Elrond and Polkadot. Other projects, in an effort to improve upon the current smart contract platforms, have opted to create specialized languages. A few of these include<a href=\"https://docs.cardano.org/marlowe/learn-about-marlowe\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Marlowe</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<a href=\"https://docs.cardano.org/plutus/learn-about-plutus\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Plutus</a><span>&nbsp;</span>on Cardano,<a href=\"https://clarity-lang.org/\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Clarity</a><span>&nbsp;</span>on Bitcoin, or<a href=\"https://developers.flow.com/cadence/index\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Cadence</a><span>&nbsp;</span>on Flow.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"158002865","title":"Do we need another smart contract language?","copy":"<p>Putting smart contracts aside for a minute, as the quote from Sam Blackshear below alludes to, the first question one should be asking is why we need another smart contract programming language.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true},{"__typename":"T010QuoteRecord","id":"158002866","author":"Sam Blackshear, CTO and co-founder at Mysten Labs","quote":"“The most valuable asset for any programming language is its community and its tooling in the existing ecosystem.

Furthermore, whether or not the language is cross-platform, will be a determining factor of the size of the community that can form around it. Just look at the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1241923/worldwide-software-developer-programming-language-communities/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20survey%2C%20the,programming%20language%20in%20the%20world.\">success of Javascript</a>. Good tooling enhances developer experience, productivity and ultimately, the quality of the end product. Solidity and Rust both have rich tooling ecosystems and developer communities. However, Rust, being the more mature language, is further ahead in this respect. For instance, Rust has a dependency management tool called<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Cargo</a>, which promotes efficient code reuse as well as vulnerability disclosure and mitigation. Solidity has no such tool and as a result, developers tend to copy/paste code from known smart contract examples, which leads to a lot of inefficient and expensive duplication.</p>\n<p>An additional consideration, especially for newer languages, is whether they bear any similarities with existing languages, as this will smooth the learning curve when onboarding new developers. As mentioned earlier, Move is inspired by Rust and Rust has been ranked the number one loved language in<a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Stackoverflow’s annual developer survey</a><span>&nbsp;</span>every year since 2016. This bodes well for Move, and a number of founders we’ve spoken to have commented that onboarding Rust developers into the Move ecosystem is relatively straightforward and can be done in a matter of weeks. In spite of this, the EVM maintains strong network effects due to the number of Solidity developers relative to other blockchains. Access to this talent pool is a primary reason why prospective projects choose to build on the EVM.</p>\n<p>So taking the above into account, why design a completely new smart contract programming language? In order to be effective within the highly specialized domain of smart contracts, languages need some very specific properties. They must be deterministic, type and memory-safe and support the notion of metered execution (for a more in-depth explanation of these, check the appendices). There aren’t any general purpose languages that have all of these properties. Rust is type and memory safe but is non-deterministic and doesn’t support metered execution. As a result, rust-based contracts are written using a restricted subset of the language and in the case of Solana, metered execution is calculated by the protocol (see appendix D). Solidity is deterministic and supports metered execution but is not memory-safe, and as discussed earlier has some security flaws.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, the feature set required from a smart contract language is very narrow. It needs to be able to guarantee scarcity of assets and securely manage ownership and access control. Beyond that, any additional features add unnecessary complexity. For this reason, rather than mutate an existing language and end up with something that is hard to work with, the design team at Facebook chose to start with a blank slate and create a lean and highly specialized language.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"158002868","title":"Move","copy":"","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":null},{"__typename":"T010QuoteRecord","id":"158002869","author":"Sam Blackshear, CTO and Founder at Mysten Labs","quote":"“The Move hypothesis is that if we provide first-class abstractions for these key concepts [asset scarcity and access control], we can significantly improve both the safety of smart contracts and the productivity of smart contract programmers—having the right vocabulary for the task at hand changes everything.”"},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"158002870","title":"","copy":"<p>Move is a fully deterministic, statically typed language that has inherited Rust’s memory safety guarantees.

Because all assets are represented by this resource type, no particular asset has special status, and scarcity is enforced natively for all assets. This is in contrast to Ethereum’s model, where Ether is the only native asset and every other asset is implemented using token standards (e.g. ERC20) who’s scarcity rules must be explicitly encoded and checked against in a smart contract.

The Sui ecosystem is one area we’re keeping a close eye on due to their focus on becoming the next generation blockchain for Web3 games. Furthermore, the Mysten team includes many of the original minds behind Move, including its chief designer, Sam Blackshear.</p>\n<p>So why are there multiple versions of Move? Some of the original language design choices were made with a permissioned blockchain in mind (Diem). Furthermore, the release of the initial version predated the rise in popularity of NFTs. As a result, the Mysten team claim that in its original form, the Move language is suboptimal for some of today’s use cases, particularly around NFTs and games. They therefore opted to create a new optimized version called<a href=\"https://sui.io/resources-move/why-we-created-sui-move/\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Sui Move</a>, made possible due to the aforementioned embedded design of Move’s core language. The main differences between the Sui Move and the original “Diem” Move are primarily around the data storage model.As discussed earlier, in the original version of Move, global storage is keyed by address/type pairs. This means only one type of asset per address can be stored at a given key. An address can of course own many different resource types, but this requires creating a new key within global storage for each new asset created. If a game developer wanted to airdrop a new item to each player address this would require a new key associated with that resource type to be created at each player address. Every user would also have to explicitly opt-in to receiving that asset. Put another way, for every user receiving an item, two transactions would need to be executed. In Sui Move there exists the notion of objects and global storage is keyed by an objects unique ID. When a resource is created in Sui Move, it is associated with a unique global object ID and has metadata assigned to it to indicate ownership addresses. With this storage model an item could be airdropped to millions of users in a single transaction. A more detailed justification can be found<a href=\"https://sui.io/resources-move/why-we-created-sui-move/\"><span>&nbsp;</span>here</a>.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":true},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"158002887","title":"What Does This All Mean for Web3 Gaming?","copy":"<p>It is our thesis at BITKRAFT that Web3 is going to be the next major paradigm shift in gaming, resulting in billions of new users coming on-chain.

The designers of the Move language claim that due to the resource-centric data model of Move, they are able to achieve unlimited “Web2-style” horizontal scaling. Because the global state is organized around individual resources, transactions can explicitly declare which resources will be impacted and the protocol can ignore all others. This is different from the EVM, where smart contracts frequently cause points of contention (bottlenecks). Transactions that require ordering because they touch the same resources are processed sequentially, whereas transactions with no interdependencies can be processed in parallel. Moreover, simple transactions on Sui (like a p2p payment) that don’t have complex interdependencies can actually forgo consensus altogether and take the faster, low latency Byzantine Consistent Broadcast path. For a more in-depth explanation see the<a href=\"https://docs.sui.io/learn/how-sui-works\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Sui docs</a>.</p>\n<p>We may see interested game developers more readily adopt Move-based ecosystems due to the similarities with asset representation.

The design principles of safety, native scarcity and access control, along with the new resource-centric data model are a novel approach and effectively negate many vulnerabilities seen in today’s smart contracts. Move’s safety guarantees, as well as advanced formal verification tools like the Move Prover, could help lessen the burden of responsibility on developers and allow them to focus on building great apps and games. Move is based on Rust, which is already used in game development and is consistently voted the most loved language in Stackoverflow’s annual developer survey. Furthermore, Rusts adoption on existing blockchain platforms could be indicative that Move will also be popular.

Any value assigned to a variable must be of the same type to avoid errors during compilation. For this reason, statically typed languages are considered more secure than dynamically typed languages but also more but verbose and less readable. It’s worth noting that even if the code compiles successfully, it doesn’t mean the application will be clear of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error\"><span>&nbsp;</span>logical errors</a>. Depending on the executable produced, execution will be much faster than interpreted code as there is no overhead added by an interpreter.Dynamically typed languages are not compiled and do not require the developer to declare types in the code. As a result, these languages are more succinct. A variable’s type is inferred by an interpreter at run time and may change depending on what value is assigned to it.

This is clearly an issue when deploying immutable code into an adversarial environment, as these potential errors could be exploited by malicious actors. Smart contract languages usually take a middle ground.

It laid out a novel approach for securely creating digital assets centered around native scarcity and access control. Its semantics are inspired by Rust, and it aims to address the issues and short-comings the designers identified in the available languages at the time (both smart contract specific and general purpose). This article will explore some of Moves features, components and tools, how they compare with existing smart contract languages, and what this new ecosystem could mean for the Web3 gaming
