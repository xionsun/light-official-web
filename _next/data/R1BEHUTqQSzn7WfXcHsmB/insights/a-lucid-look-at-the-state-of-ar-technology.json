Interoperability can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the traditional gaming space, games can be interoperable across platforms, e.g., launching on Xbox, Playstation and PC. Within the Web3 space, there exists the notion of cross-chain interoperability, which allows assets to traverse multiple different blockchains, usually via bridge contracts. Another type of interoperability unique to Web3 is that of cross-application interoperable or portable game assets. The underlying substrate that is the blockchain in theory allows assets (NFTs or fungible tokens) to have utility in any of the applications built on top of it.

Last year, Niantic’s Founder and CEO John Hanke notably<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://nianticlabs.com/news/real-world-metaverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dismissed</a><span>&nbsp;</span>the idea of a “<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/future-of-the-metaverse-vr-ar-and-brain-computer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">digital escape</a>” as “a dystopian nightmare” and instead encouraged others in the industry to “lean into the ‘reality’ of augmented reality — encouraging everyone, ourselves included, to stand up, walk outside, and connect with people and the world around us.” This is the vision we’ll be discussing here.</p>\n<p>AR has seen some notable traction over the past few years. Research conducted by Deloitte for Snap last year<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://downloads.ctfassets.net/inb32lme5009/4Jh1ODwYalSM5VtORhSC9B/8e6ec4bf98015f47d762846b4e5e1170/Snap_Consumer_AR_Research_Global_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">found</a><span>&nbsp;</span>AR adoption to be “tracking with the mobile usage boom,” and estimated that “nearly 75% of the global population and almost all smartphone users will be frequent AR users” by 2025.</p>\n<p>Today, however,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>most AR consumption still takes place on social and communication apps and within the confines of the smartphone screen</strong>, rather than on the AR-native wearables that have been consistently presented to us as inevitable.

These toolboxes are lowering barriers to creation and empowering brands and indie creators alike to experiment with the medium.</p>\n<p><strong>On the other hand, hardware is facing challenges.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Despite their much-publicized ambitions, even deep-pocketed companies like Apple and Meta have been repeatedly postponing the release of their first AR headset. The dream of experiencing AR on a dedicated device still seems like a distant one. In the meantime, however, the use of AR on smartphones, already widespread, offers a convincing transition toward a more fully immersive future.</p>\n<p>Looking at these two aspects will help us grasp where AR stands today, and what needs to be solved if we want to bring the technology to the next level.</p>","button":"","url":"","openInNewTab":true,"fullWidthMobile":false},{"__typename":"T014SectionTitleRecord","id":"160732176","title":"Fast-Forward: A Look At Our AR Future"},{"__typename":"T003ContentRecord","id":"160732177","title":"","copy":"<p>Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of today’s market, let’s remind ourselves what it is that AR is building toward.</p>\n<p>At its core,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>AR promises to enrich our surroundings with a digital layer of content and context that can be activated at will depending on our needs.<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>The technology itself is agnostic: it can (and will) be used across all use cases, from fun to commerce and from education to navigation.
